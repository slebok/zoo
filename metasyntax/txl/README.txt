Description:
    TXL transformation grammar and pretty-printer for version 10.5 of 
    TXL itself.  Handles and preserves comments and TXL preprocessor 
    statements.

    Note: Pretty printing is an approximation since we cannot guess
    what the formatting conventions for the target language used in 
    defines, patterns and replacements looks like.  All TXL syntax 
    is properly formatted in standard form.
