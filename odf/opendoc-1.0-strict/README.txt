OASIS Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) TC
Developing an XML-based file format specification for office applications

Technical Work Produced by the Committee

Open Document Format v1.0 was approved as an OASIS Standard on 1 May 2005. It is available in PDF and in OpenOffice.org XML formats.

Open Document Format 1.0 Approved Errata 01 was approved by the ODF TC on 24 November 2008 and is available for download in ODF, PDF and HTML formats.

Open Document Format v1.0 (Second Edition) specification was approved as a Committee Specification on 19 July 2006. It is available in OpenDocument and in PDF formats.

Open Document Format v1.0 has been approved by ISO/IEC JTC1 as an International Standard ISO/IEC 26300:2006.

The specification defines three Relax-NG schemas:

The schema for office documents (defined in chapters 1 to 16),
the normative schema for the manifest file used by the OpenDocument package format (defined in chapter 17), and
the strict schema for office documents that permits only meta information and formatting properties contained in this specification itself (defined in appendix A).
These three schemas are also available separately:

OpenDocument v1.0 Relax-NG Schema (extracted from chapter 1 to 16 of the specification)
OpenDocument v1.0 Manifest Relax-NG Schema (extracted from chapter 17 of the specification)
OpenDocument v1.0 Strict Relax-NG Schema (extracted from appendix A of the specification)
