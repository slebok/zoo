Description :  ebXML (Electronic Business using eXtensible Markup Language), is a modular suite of specifications that enables enterprises of any size and in any geographical location to conduct business over the Internet.

The original project envisioned and delivered five layers of substantive data specification, including XML standards for: Business processes , Core data components, Collaboration protocol agreements, Messaging, Registries and repositories.
