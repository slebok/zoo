MTRANS 0.1
date : 2005/08/10
Domain : Model transformation
Description :  This metamodel describes MTRANS. The MTRANS project aims to supply a general framework for expressing model transformations. In order to be as general as possible, it is based on a meta-modeling approach (a meta-model is used to define the semantics of each model). The MTRANS framework is supplying a language and an environment to write models transformations. The language is composed by a fixed instruction set (conditional, loop, etc.) plus a part depending on the particular meta-models used. MTRANS was a precursor to QVT languages.
