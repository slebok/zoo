PetriNet 5.0
date : 2007/11/19
Domain : 
Description :  This metamodel is presented by Guido Wachsmut in the paper Metamodel Adaptation and Model Co-adaption. The metamodel captures a Petri net. A Petri net is composed of several places and transitions (at least one place and one transition). Each transition has at least one input place and one output place. Arcs between places and transitions are explicit. PTArc and TPArc are respectively representing place-to-transition arcs and transition-to-place ones. Arcs are annotated with weight. In order to model dynamic aspects, places need to be marked with tokens.
